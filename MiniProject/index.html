            My name is Qihui Wang. I'm a second year student at GT. I'm from China, but I've been studying in the US almost
            eight
            years. I've studied in Ohio for three years high school, and graudated at a high school in North Carilina. Then
            I went
            to Penn State University when I was a freshman. I met Xisheng there. He then decided to transefer to GT and
            introduce me
            how great GT is. Then I also decided to transfer here. We both loves cats. We have three cats together. Their
            names are
            Richy, Lucky and Wishy. We also went to a lot of places since we've been together.
