            We had our first cat last year. He is a cute sweet boy. When realize that when we are buzy during the school
            year, he is
            staying at home alone. We felt bad because he didn't have anyone to accompany with if we get buzy, so we
            decide to get
            another cat. When we were looking around for adopting cat, these two littles one came into our eyes. It's so
            hard to
            decide which one to adopt, so we adopted both of them.
