            When I was at Penn State. I used to be a Learning Assistant. My job was helping student success in the
            Calculus with
            Analytic Geometry course. I provided academic assistance to students and answered their questions with
            regards to
            homework and exam preparation. Also hosted evening discussion sessions twice a week to explain complex
            mathematic
            problems and wrote up practice worksheets to help students better understand difficult concepts.
